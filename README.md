# Deep Learning Challenge
Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp Challenge 21

## Overview
Alphabet Soup is a nonprofit organization that provides funding to applicants for various ventures. The organization would like a tool that can help them predict an applicant's chance of success. This would of course be very useful since, with such a tool, Alphabet Soup would be able to make sure their limited funding is going to those ventures which will really benefit from it, and less money would be wasted.

In an attempt to provide such a tool, this project uses machine learning and neural networks to attempt to predict the outcome of a venture based on several criteria, including affiliation (independent or company-sponsored), organization (e.g. association, co-operative, or trust), and income. These criteria are the features (X) for the model, while the target (y) is the outcome (encoded in the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column of the imported DataFrame as 0 = unsuccessful and 1 = successul). 

## Results
We make two attempts to create a viable model. The initial model is produced in the Jupyter Notebook 'AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb'. We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries (in particular sklearn and tensorflow, which we will use to create and run the neural network).
